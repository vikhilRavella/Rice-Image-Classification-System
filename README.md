<h1> Rice Image Classification System</h1>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This project, developed as part of my AI Internship experience, aims to build a Rice Image Classification System using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to classify images of rice into different categories based on predefined labels. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify rice varieties, helping automate agricultural processes such as quality control and classification.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Rice is a staple food for millions around the world. Differentiating various types of rice based on their appearance is crucial for quality control and processing. This project addresses the need for an automated system that can classify rice images accurately, thus streamlining agricultural practices and food supply chain management.</p>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>The project’s primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that classifies rice images into different categories. Automating this process will help reduce human error, save time, and increase the efficiency of rice quality assessments in the agricultural industry.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>The motivation behind this project is to develop a system that can automate the classification of rice images, making the process faster, more reliable, and less dependent on human intervention. By applying artificial intelligence to this problem, we can improve the agricultural industry’s efficiency and accuracy in rice quality classification.</p>

<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To design and develop a Rice Image Classification System using machine learning.</li>
  <li>To train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify various rice varieties.</li>
  <li>To deploy the model in a practical setting for real-time image classification.</li>
  <li>To evaluate the model’s performance using key metrics such as accuracy and loss.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Methodology</h4>
<p>The methodology involves the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Data Collection:</b> Collect a large set of rice images that represent various rice varieties.</li>
  <li><b>Preprocessing:</b> Resize, normalize, and augment the images to enhance the dataset and make the model more robust.</li>
  <li><b>Model Building:</b> A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to classify the rice images.</li>
  <li><b>Training & Evaluation:</b> The model is trained on the data and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
  <li><b>Deployment:</b> The trained model is integrated into a user-friendly interface for real-time classification of rice images.</li>
</ol>
