Rice Image Classification System

*Overview
This project, developed as part of my AI Internship experience, aims to build a Rice Image Classification System using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to classify images of rice into different categories based on predefined labels. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately classify rice varieties, helping automate agricultural processes such as quality control and classification.

*Introduction
Rice is a staple food for millions around the world. Differentiating various types of rice based on their appearance is crucial for quality control and processing. This project addresses the need for an automated system that can classify rice images accurately, thus streamlining agricultural practices and food supply chain management.

*Problem Statement
The project’s primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that classifies rice images into different categories. Automating this process will help reduce human error, save time, and increase the efficiency of rice quality assessments in the agricultural industry.

*Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to develop a system that can automate the classification of rice images, making the process faster, more reliable, and less dependent on human intervention. By applying artificial intelligence to this problem, we can improve the agricultural industry’s efficiency and accuracy in rice quality classification.

*Objectives
To design and develop a Rice Image Classification System using machine learning.
To train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify various rice varieties.
To deploy the model in a practical setting for real-time image classification.
To evaluate the model’s performance using key metrics such as accuracy and loss.

*Methodology
The methodology involves the following steps:

*Data Collection: Collect a large set of rice images that represent various rice varieties.
Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment the images to enhance the dataset and make the model more robust.
Model Building: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to classify the rice images.
Training & Evaluation: The model is trained on the data and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: The trained model is integrated into a user-friendly interface for real-time classification of rice images.

*Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
  $:git clone https://github.com/your-username/rice-image-classifier.git

Navigate to the project directory:
  $:cd rice-image-classifier

Install the required dependencies: It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
  $:pip install -r requirements.txt

*Usage
To run the project and classify rice images, follow these steps:
Prepare your image: Upload a rice image to be classified.
Run the classification script:
$:python classify_rice.py --image your_image_path.jpg
View the results: The classification result will display the predicted rice variety and confidence level.


*Results
Model Accuracy: The model’s accuracy is evaluated after training using a validation dataset.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: These metrics are calculated to understand the model’s performance in more detail.
Example output:

*Internship Experience

This project was developed during my AI Internship under the AI: Transformative Learning program with TechSaksham, a joint CSR initiative by Microsoft and SAP. The internship provided me with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in applying AI technologies to real-world problems, including image classification and deep learning.

Throughout the internship, I learned:

->Building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
->Data preprocessing techniques to improve the quality and performance of machine learning models.
->Model evaluation using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
->Deployment of models for real-time use cases.
I would like to express my gratitude to the TechSaksham team, my mentors, and colleagues for their continuous support, feedback, and encouragement throughout the internship period.
