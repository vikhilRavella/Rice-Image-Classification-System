# Rice Classification Model

## Overview
This project, developed as part of my AI Internship experience, aims to build a **Rice Image Classification System** using **machine learning techniques**. The system is designed to classify images of rice into different categories based on predefined labels. The project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to accurately classify rice varieties, helping automate agricultural processes such as quality control and classification.

## Introduction
Rice is a staple food for millions around the world. Differentiating various types of rice based on their appearance is crucial for quality control and processing. This project addresses the need for an **automated system** that can classify rice images accurately, thus streamlining **agricultural practices and food supply chain management**.

## Problem Statement
The projectâ€™s primary goal is to develop a **machine learning model** that classifies rice images into different categories. Automating this process will help:
- Reduce human error.
- Save time.
- Increase efficiency in rice quality assessments within the agricultural industry.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to develop a **system that automates rice classification**, making the process:
- **Faster**
- **More reliable**
- **Less dependent on human intervention**

By applying **artificial intelligence**, we can improve efficiency and accuracy in **rice quality classification**.

## Objectives
- Develop a **Rice Image Classification System** using machine learning.
- Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to identify various rice varieties.
- Deploy the model in a **practical setting** for real-time classification.
- Evaluate model performance using key metrics such as **accuracy and loss**.

## Methodology
The methodology involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a large dataset of rice images representing different rice varieties.
2. **Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and augment the images to enhance the dataset and improve model robustness.
3. **Model Building:** Train a **CNN-based deep learning model** to classify rice images.
4. **Training & Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model using **Streamlit Lite** for a user-friendly web interface.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rice-image-classifier.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd rice-image-classifier
